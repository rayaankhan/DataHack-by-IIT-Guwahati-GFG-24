# DataHack-by-IIT-Guwahati-GFG-24
This repository is for the submission for the Hackathon by GeeksForGeeks under the Summer Analytics course from IIT-G '24

### Checking purpose
- Code: `hackathon.ipynb`
- Output CSV: `submission.csv`

## Overview
For this problem, I have used sequential Neural Network. In this NN, I have used 2 hidden layers, one input later and one output layer. ReLU is used as activation function. 
ROC AUC scores have been calculated on the validation set and are being displayed in the output which can be seen in the hackathon.ipynb file. The final result has been stored in the submission.csv and added the github link.

Proper comments in the code is given for better readability and understanding the idea behind the solution.

## Installation
Step-by-step instructions on how to set up and run your project locally.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/rayaankhan/DataHack-by-IIT-Guwahati-GFG-24.git
